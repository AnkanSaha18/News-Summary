    Args:
        model:
            DDP model
        ddp_comm_state:
            state is passed to the hook and can be used to maintain
            and update any state information that users would like to
            maintain as part of the training process. Examples: error
            feedback in gradient compression, peers to communicate with
            next in GossipGrad etc.
        ddp_comm_hook:
            hook(state: object, bucket: dist._GradBucket) -> torch.futures.Future

            This callable function is called once the bucket is ready. The
            hook can perform whatever processing is needed and return
            a Future indicating completion of any async work (ex: allreduce).
            If the hook doesn't perform any communication, it can also
            just return a completed Future. The Future should hold the
            new value of grad bucket's tensors. Once a bucket is ready,
            c10d reducer would call this hook and use the tensors returned
            by the Future and copy grads to individual parameters.
        ddp_comm_wrapper:
            communication hook wrapper to support a communication hook such
            as FP16 compression as wrapper, which could be combined with
